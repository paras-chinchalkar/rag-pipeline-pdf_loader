Cancer is one of the most \\ndreaded diseases of the 20th\\xa0 century and spreading further \\nwith continuance and increasing incidence in the 21st\\xa0century. \\nThe situation is so alarming that every fourth person is \\nhaving a lifetime risk of cancer.[1] India registers more than \\n11 lakh new cases of cancer every year, whereas, this figure \\nis above 14 million worldwide. We are constantly exposed \\nto a variety of cancer causing agents, known as carcinogens.\\nWhat is cancer? Put simply; cancer is the abnormal growth \\nof cells. Cancers arise from any organ or body structure and \\nare composed of tiny cells that have lost the ability to stop \\ngrowing. Occasionally, cancer may be detected “incidentally” by \\na laboratory test or radiological routine test or for an entirely \\ndifferent reason. In general, cancer must reach a size of 1 \\ncm, or be comprised of 1 million cells, before it is detected. \\nAt this point, it may be referred to as a “‘mass,” a “growth,” \\na “tumor,” a “nodule,” a “lump,” or a “lesion.” Exceptions \\nto this general rule include cancers of the blood and bone \\nmarrow\\xa0(leukemia’s and lymphomas)\\xa0–\\xa0which frequently do \\nnot produce a “mass,” but will be evident on laboratory tests.\\nTransformation of a normal cell into a cancerous cell is \\nprobably not such a critical event in the genesis of cancer; \\nrather it is the inability of immune cells of the body to \\nidentify and destroy the newly formed cancer cells when \\nthey are a few in numbers.[2] The risk of cancer is multiplied \\nin those persons, whose immune system is suppressed due \\nto any factor including chronic stress, old age, chronic \\ndebilitating disease, previous use of chemotherapy, and abuse \\nof drugs such as analgesics, antibiotics, and corticosteroids.\\nMultidisciplinary Aspects\\nCancer cells continue to grow unless one of four things \\noccur:\\xa0 (1) The cancerous mass is removed surgically; \\n(2) using chemotherapy or another type of cancer‑specific \\nmedication, such as hormonal therapy;\\xa0(3) using radiation \\ntherapy; or\\xa0(4) the cancer cells shrink and disappear on their \\nown. This last event, while extremely rare, can occur with \\nsome melanomas or some kidney cancers.\\nSurgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy from the \\nconventional approaches are used to treat cancer. Surgery \\nwas the first modality used successfully in the treatment of \\ncancer. It is the only curative therapy for many common \\nsolid tumors. The most important determinant of a successful \\nsurgical therapy is the absence of distant metastases and \\nno local infiltration. Chemotherapy is the administration \\nof cytotoxic agents\\xa0 (orally or intravenously, usually in \\ncombinations) resulting in cytotoxicity to both resting and \\ndividing cells. The objective of cancer chemotherapy is to \\nprevent cancer cells from multiplying, invading, metastasizing, \\nand killing the patient. Systemic chemotherapy is the main \\ntreatment available for disseminated malignant diseases. \\nRadiation therapy is a local modality used in the treatment of \\ncancer. Other conventional techniques used in the treatment \\nof cancer including bone marrow transplantation, peripheral \\nstem cell transplantation, hormone therapy, photodynamic \\ntherapy, cryosurgery, immunotherapy, and gene therapy.\\nIs cancer curable? The short answer to this question is “Yes.” In \\nfact, all cancers are curable if they are caught early enough. That \\nis the justification for screening tests\\xa0(such as mammograms, \\ncolonoscopies, and Pap smear examination). When cancers are \\ncaught early, they tend to be smaller; they are thus either easier \\nto remove surgically or more likely to shrink in response to \\nchemotherapy or radiation therapy. When cancer is localized, it \\ncan be totally removed by surgery but in most of the cases, it \\nis practically impossible to detect cancer at such an early stage. \\nEarly detection is often the key to surviving any form of cancer.\\nThe diagnosis and treatment of cancer have come a long way \\nin the last 50\\xa0years. In the past, cancer, the “C‑word,” was a \\ndeath sentence. Today, we can treat and cure several types of \\ncancer; however, it is evident that these cancers need to be \\nfound at an early stage. More than 7 out of 10 children are \\ncured of cancer. Testicular cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and \\nHow to cite this article: Roy P, Saikia B. Cancer and cure: A \\ncritical analysis.

Most skin cancers are cured with surgery. Moreover, \\nmany cases of thyroid cancer and cancer of the larynx are cured \\nwith radiotherapy. Many other types of cancer are also cured \\nif they are found early enough\\xa0–\\xa0for example, 75% of breast \\ncancers found at an early stage. Of course, there is still a long \\nway to go before we can cure most cancers. The difficulty is \\nthat different cancers are caused by different things, so there \\nis not one strategy that can prevent them. They also respond \\nto different treatments, so not one kind of treatment can cure \\nthem all. Even though we can cure several types of cancers, it \\nis important to maintain vigilance about screening for cancer.\\nSome forms of cancer are curable no matter when they \\nare detected, and some are only curable if they are caught \\nat any early stage. For example, acute leukemia and some \\ntypes of lymphoma can be curable with chemotherapy. \\nCertain lymphomas such as Hodgkin’s disease require \\nradiation therapy for a cure. Other common cancers such \\nas colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, \\nand pancreatic cancer are all curable, but only if they are \\ndetected in early stages\\xa0(Stage I or II).\\nSome cancers have high survival rates with early detection. \\nSix highly treatable cancers among others are\\xa0–\\xa0cancers of \\nbreast, skin\\xa0 (nonmelanomas), colon, prostate, testes, and \\ncervix. Most of the childhood malignancies\\xa0(both solid and \\nhematolymphoid) are curable.\\nBreast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among \\nwomen, as one out of every eight women will be diagnosed \\nin her lifetime. In patients whose breast cancer is detected \\nwhile still in localized form have a 5‑year survival rate of \\n98%, compared with a survival rate of 72% by Stage III \\nand just 22% by Stage IV.[3,4]\\nSkin cancers\\xa0 (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell \\ncarcinoma) are the most common form of all human cancers, \\nand if found early, skin cancer is nearly 100% treatable. \\nLikewise, diagnosing cervical cancer while the lesions are \\nprecancerous leads to a near 100% survival rate, but the \\nrate drops to just 32% if diagnosed in Stage III and 16% if \\ndiagnosed at Stage IV. Testicular cancer is treatable in 99% \\nof the time when detected early, but only 73% are cancer‑free \\nafter 5\\xa0years if diagnosed in advanced stages. Similarly, 5‑year \\nsurvival rate when colon cancer is detected early is 90%, yet \\nonly 39% of cases are diagnosed before cancer has begun to \\nspread. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End \\nResults Program, it is 98% survivable for 5 or more years \\nif prostate cancer diagnosed at stages when the disease is \\nconfined to the prostate gland\\xa0(Stage I and II).[1] The survival \\nrate drops to about 28% if diagnosed at Stage IV.\\nCancers cells not only have mutations that result in \\ndysregulated expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor \\ngenes, but these changes result in the alteration of expression \\nof hundreds of genes. Looking at this, we have various forms \\nof “targeted” therapy directed at specific single molecular \\ntargets or a class of molecular targets in cancer cells. With \\ntargeted therapy, the specific mechanism of action of the drug \\nresults in an increase in its therapeutic index. Currently, the \\ntwo major classes of targeted therapy are the small molecule \\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies\\xa0(MABs). \\nImatinib, for instance, has been amazingly successful as a \\ntargeted agent directed against several members of a class of \\nenzyme known as tyrosine kinases, and by that mechanism, \\nit has been phenomenally successful as a treatment of chronic \\nmyeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. \\nTamoxifen is a targeted therapy directed at the estrogen \\nreceptor\\xa0(ER), and it still remains a mainstay of treatment for \\nER‑positive breast cancers, along with a newer class of drugs \\nknown as aromatase inhibitors.\\nCancer researchers work on developing new and more \\neffective surgery techniques, radiotherapy and chemotherapy \\ndrugs all the time. Biological therapies such as MABs, \\ncancer vaccines, and gene therapies are all active areas of \\nresearch. There are various anti‑angiogenic drugs that can \\nstop cancers from growing the blood vessels that they need. \\nResearch is also looking into developing cost‑effective ways \\nof screening for the different common cancers so they can \\nbe diagnosed early enough to be cured.\\nAvoiding immune destruction is now considered a hallmark \\nof cancer, and the immunotherapy arena has exploded \\nwith the recent advances demonstrating an improvement \\nin survival and a durability of response in patients with \\ndifferent cancer types, like in melanoma, which translates \\ninto an improved overall survival benefit.[5] To name those \\nimmunotherapeutic strategies that include the adoptive \\ntransfer of ex vivo activated T cells, immunomodulatory \\nMABs, and cancer vaccines. Advances in molecular \\npathology will provide the means to identify the targets \\nand will be used to subtype tumors and will provide predict \\nresponse to therapy and provide prognostic information.[6]\\nConclusion\\nUnfortunately, although we do fairly well\\xa0(and in some cases \\nvery well) against early stage cancer, we do not do so well \\nagainst Stage IV metastatic disease, particularly solid tumors. \\nThere is still a long way to go before we can cure most cancers.\\nFinancial support and sponsorship\\nNil.\\nConflicts of interest\\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\\nReferences\\n1.\\t\\nMackay J, Jemal A, Lee NC, Parkin DM.

It is critical that you work in close collaboration with \\nsenior medical, nursing and allied health staff, along with our administrative support \\nofficers.  \\nWe have outlined some useful practice points will help you to settle into our department \\nsmoothly. \\nEducational and training resources \\nElectronic medical records \\nTownsville Cancer Centre uses MOSAIQ as its EMR. Please become familiar with \\nMOSAIQ by contacting the CNC for MOSAIQ on 32888 or through our administrative \\nsupport officers 44331671 prior to commencement. We assume that you are familiar with \\nthe ieMR, the THHS-wide EMR. \\nChemotherapy protocol \\neviQ is a very useful website to learn chemotherapy protocols and side-effects. It also \\ncontains information about managing extravasation (www.eviq.org.au). \\nNB: RMOs and interns are not expected to write chemotherapy orders. When \\nwriting oral chemotherapy, targeted agents and colony stimulating factors, please \\nexercise caution and follow the advice of your registrars and consultants.  \\nMedication prescribing \\nQuality of inpatient medication prescribing can be improved by adhering to the THHS \\nguide for inpatient medication prescription. \\nEnd of life care bedside tutorial and introduction to telehealth \\nThese two topics are available on YouTube (searchable using the titles) and are useful \\nresources for developing mental frameworks for approaching these topics. \\nBasic principles of oncology \\nClinical oncology for medical students is a useful resource for learning basic principles \\nof oncology care. \\n \\nhttp://wiki.cancer.org.au/oncologyformedicalstudents/Clinical_Oncology_for_Medical_\\nStudents'),\n",

As a rule, when it is difficult to draw blood from lines or inject \\nfluids, it is important to use imaging (including chest-Xray and linogram) for checking \\nthe position and viability before using the lines. Please seek advice when infection and \\nthrombosis are suspected/proven. We can rarely save lines using antibiotics  \\nSelf-care \\nPlease maintain physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health. Take regular breaks as \\nmuch as possible and maintain effective work-life balance (This doesn’t mean work is \\nbad and life is good; it is about having a balance that suits your needs). Please seek help \\nif you think you need help including emotional support and guidance. \\nDay unit \\n• Orientate with the Day-unit staff and introduce yourself to senior nursing \\nstaff and establish working relationships with them.   \\n• You are the first point of call for any issues in day unit and therefore, please \\nmake sure that you are always available during rostered hours. Day unit relies \\non effective discharge of patients to maintain flow. A delay due to one issue \\ncould delay the whole day’s operation and care of other patients. \\n• Infusion reactions are medical emergencies: You should always attend to a \\npatient having a reaction, leaving everything else. If you are not available, \\nplease make sure another doctor can attend the patient immediately. \\nClinics \\n• Being “On Time” is important! Clinics start on time so that patients can \\nreceive their chemotherapy in day unit without delays. \\n• If a patient is seen by the consultant in clinic, please ask them to sign the blue \\nform. \\nDealing with consultants and registrars \\nPlease don’t hesitate to seek help from senior medical staff. All changes in management \\nshould be discussed. Harass them even if they are busy!'),\n",

Targeted \\nagents and endocrine therapy are usually tolerated better than chemotherapy. \\n \\nToxicity from previous cycles of systemic therapy \\nClinicians must assess whether a side effect is affecting QOL, performance status or is \\nlife threatening: \\nFirst, determine the type and severity of side effects. \\nFor example, in patients with early breast cancers undergoing taxane chemotherapy, mild \\nperipheral neuropathy is acceptable. However, in patients undergoing fluorouracil-based \\ntherapy, ongoing or severe diarrhoea necessitates a dose delay and dose reduction of \\nsubsequent cycles. \\nMid-cycle neutropenic fever usually requires dose reduction of the subsequent cycle \\nunless the cancer is curable. If the cancer is curable or a substantial duration of remission \\nis expected, prophylactic colony stimulating factors such as pegfilgrastim (neulasta) \\nand/or antibiotics can reduce the risk of subsequent and opportunistic infections. \\n \\nNext, determine the effects on important organs, such as: \\n• Fertility. Discuss semen cryopreservation with men. Options for women \\nshould also be discussed, particularly in young women of child-bearing \\npotential and where curative intention treatment is planned.  Options include \\npreservation of egg, embryo and a piece of ovary is offered by some fertility \\ngroups. Women who wish to discuss this option should be referred to a \\nfertility specialist. \\n• Renal function, liver functions. \\n• Cardiac function. This may affect the dosage of anthracyclines (check \\nejection fraction before treatment begins and after every 2–3 cycles) and \\ntrastuzumab (check ejection fraction before treatment begins and every 3 \\nmonths during therapy). \\nToxicity is graded according to NCI common terminology criteria for adverse events1. \\n1.

However, basic principles are as \\nfollows: \\n(Also refer to the Guide for inpatient medication prescription) \\n1. Pain:    Always find out the cause of the pain before prescribing analgesics. \\nTotal daily morphine requirement will guide the required daily slow release dose. \\nWhen prescribing breakthrough, the dose is 1/6th of the daily dose. So, if you are \\nincreasing the daily dose, breakthrough needs to increase as well. If oral intake is \\ndifficult—patches or infusional morphine are options. \\n4. Dyspnoea:    Again, find out the cause, for cancer related dyspnoea—nebulised \\nmorphine and anxiolytics could be helpful. \\nWhen to stop cancer treatment \\nA decision to stop treatment prematurely depends on the aim of the treatment. \\nFor curable cancers, it is acceptable to continue treatment with dose modifications. \\nHowever, life threatening or severe dose limiting toxicities usually necessitate cessation \\nof treatment (eg. moderate to severe peripheral neuropathy with taxanes and oxaliplatin, \\nsevere enteritis from fluorouracil). Alternative regimens are sometimes available. \\nIf the cancer is incurable and the toxicities severely interfere with the activities of daily \\nliving, treatment may have to be stopped. \\nDeteriorating performance status and organ function usually require cessation of \\ntreatment. Ongoing neutropenia or thrombocytopenia typically means the patient is not \\ngoing to handle further chemotherapy. \\nIn case of patients with metastatic disease, palliative care team referral is done even when \\nthey are on active treatment, to improve symptom management and supportive care.'),\n",

IrAEs include dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine, and other less \\ncommon inflammatory events4. \\nIn general, treatment of moderate or severe irAEs requires interruption of the checkpoint \\ninhibitor and the use of corticosteroid immunosuppression. Treatment is based upon the \\nseverity of the observed toxicity: \\n• For patients with grade 2 (moderate) immune-mediated toxicities, treatment \\nwith the checkpoint inhibitor should be withheld and should not be resumed \\nuntil symptoms or toxicity is grade 1 or less. Corticosteroids should be started \\nif symptoms do not resolve quickly. \\n• For patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening) immune-\\nmediated toxicities, treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor should be \\npermanently discontinued. High doses of corticosteroids (prednisone 1 to 2 \\nmg/kg/day or equivalent) should be given. When symptoms subside to grade \\n1 or less, steroids can be gradually tapered over at least one month. \\n• Patients who will benefit from corticosteroids generally do so within days. If \\nsymptoms do not clearly improve, particularly after approximately three days \\nwith intravenous steroids, our approach is to administer infliximab (5 mg/kg) \\nrather than continue with a prolonged course of high-dose IV corticosteroids. \\nIf symptoms persist after the first infliximab dose, a second dose of \\ninfliximab (5 mg/kg) can be repeated two weeks after the initial dose. \\n \\n \\nDetailed management of various toxicities is covered by Cancer Institute of NSW’s \\neviQ:Cancer Treatments Online site.

In patients who cannot tolerate AI or where it is \\ncontraindicated, Tamoxifen is used.  \\nIn post-menopausal patients who start treatment with tamoxifen, switching to AI \\nafter 2-3 years is recommended. \\n5-10 additional years of aromatase inhibitors after 5 years of tamoxifen improves \\nsurvival in high-risk patients.  \\nFor patients on AIs and documented osteopaenia addition of bisphosphonates \\ndecreases the risk of decline in bone density.  They are also encouraged to take \\nregular calcium and vitamin D tablets.  DEXA scans are done yearly to two yearly \\nfor monitoring bone health in patients on aromatase inhibitors. \\nChemotherapy regimens- \\n• Lower risk/Average risk- 4x TC,  \\n• High risk- 3x FEC- 3x D OR AC-weekly Taxol OR AC- dd Taxol. AC may \\nbe given in dose dense fashion (preferred if possible). \\n• In Her-2 positive disease, Trastuzumab is combined with Taxanes and not \\nwith anthracyclines because of risk of cardiac toxicity. Eg FEC-D Herceptin \\nor AC-Taxol Trastuzumab.

Treatment modality is individualised based \\non several factors: age and co morbidities of the patient, serum PSA level, \\nGleeson score, clinical stage and patient preference based on benefits and \\nside effects of therapy. \\nFor example, a patient with clinically non apparent tumour with Gleason score of \\n<6 who has a life expectancy of <10 years could be actively observed without any \\nimpact on survival. \\nFor locally advanced inoperable disease, radical radiotherapy could lead to cure. \\nAndrogen deprivation therapy is sometimes used for short periods (4-6 months) \\nbefore/concomitantly/ after radiotherapy in selected high-risk patients.  \\n \\nMetastatic disease is incurable and the aims are to prolong survival and improve \\nquality of life. \\n \\nHormone Sensitive disease: \\n• All Hormone sensitive tumours are treated with a GnRH agonist (eg- \\ngoserelin, leuprorelin). To prevent flare, antiandrogens (eg- flutamide, are \\nstarted 1-2 weeks before the injection and continued for a total of 3-4 weeks). \\nWhether anti- androgens are continued beyond that is controversial.  \\n• Chemotherapy with Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 x 6 doses, can be added to \\nhormonal therapy in fit patients with high volume (presence of visceral mets \\nor >= 4 bony mets) metastatic disease, as it improves survival significantly \\n(CHAARTED, STAMPEDE trials). \\nHormone Refractory disease: \\n• Hormone refractory disease includes patients where the disease has \\nprogressed despite hormonal manipulation.  GnRH agonists are usually \\ncontinued.   \\n• Chemotherapy improves median survival by up to 3 months and maintains \\nimprovement in quality of life.  \\n• Bone metastases are treated with intravenous bisphosphonates (eg-zoledronic \\nacid) or RANK-ligand inhibitor Denosumab monthly.  For asymptomatic and \\nlow volume disease, chemotherapy is usually delayed.'),\n",
